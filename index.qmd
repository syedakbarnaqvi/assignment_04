## Data Used

For this assignment, we are using the **Community Resilience Estimates from the U.S Census Bureau:** (<https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/community-resilience-estimates.html>)

The CRE tracks how at-risk every single neighborhood in the United States is to the impacts of COVID-19 and other local disasters, by measuring the capacity of individuals and households at absorbing, enduring and recovering from the external stresses of the impacts of a disaster.
